# htOS - x86 Hobby OS
Note: This project is a work in progress and is in its very early stages of development, the code is bad - I'm learning.


## Why?
Why not? So far, I've quite enjoyed learning about how low level hardware interactions work, and how operating systems work generally.

## Features

 - Very basic physical memory manager 
 - Simple time slice pre-emptive scheduler
 - Basic ISR and IRQ handling
